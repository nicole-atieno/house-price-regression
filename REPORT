Project Overview

The aim of this project was to analyze a House Price dataset and build a model to predict house prices based on given features. The project followed a complete data science workflow: loading data, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model building, and evaluation.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. Data Collection

Imported libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.


2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Checked the dataset shape and first few rows (.head()).

Identified missing values and handled them appropriately.

Checked data types of each column (categorical vs numerical).

Renamed/standardized column names for clarity.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.

Distribution checks: used value counts and summary statistics to understand feature spread.

Visualizations:

Bar Graph: Showed distribution of categorical variables (e.g., number of bedrooms).

Heatmap: Displayed correlation between features and the target variable (house price).

(Optional if you later add) Scatter Plot: Showed relationships between continuous features like size vs. price.



4. Feature Selection

From the heatmap, identified the features most correlated with house price.

Dropped irrelevant or weakly correlated features to simplify the model.


5. Splitting the Dataset

Divided the data into training set (for model learning) and testing set (for evaluation).


6. Model Building

Chose Linear Regression as the baseline model.

Trained the model using the training set.

Predicted house prices on the test set.


7. Model Evaluation

Evaluated model accuracy using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R¬≤ Score


Compared actual vs predicted values to assess performance.

üìä Visualizations Included

Bar Graph: Showed how categorical features (like number of rooms) were distributed.

Heatmap: Helped in identifying correlation strength between features and house price.

‚úÖ Key Insights

Features such as size of the house and number of rooms had the strongest positive correlation with house prices.

Some features had little to no effect and could be dropped without hurting model performance.

The regression model gave a reasonable baseline performance, but advanced models could improve accuracy.
