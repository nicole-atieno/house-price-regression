# house-price-regression
Home Value Prediction Project
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning regression models to predict house prices based on various property features. The models are trained and evaluated on the "Home Value Insights" dataset from Kaggle to determine the best-performing algorithm for house price prediction.

üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Home Value Insights" dataset from Kaggle, which contains various features related to residential properties and their corresponding prices.

Source: Home Value Insights Dataset on Kaggle

Features: The dataset includes multiple property characteristics that may influence house prices, such as location, size, number of rooms, age, and other relevant attributes.

Target Variable: House_Price - The actual price of the property.

üöÄ Features
Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline

Handling of missing values through removal

Automatic encoding of categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Implementation and comparison of six regression models

Model performance evaluation using multiple metrics (MSE and R¬≤)

Visualization of comparative model performance

üìä Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression
Description: A basic linear approach that models the relationship between the input features and the target variable using a linear equation.

Strengths: Simple, interpretable, and fast to train.

Limitations: Assumes linear relationship between features and target, which may not capture complex patterns.

2. Ridge Regression
Description: A regularized version of linear regression that adds L2 regularization (sum of squared coefficients) to prevent overfitting.

Strengths: Handles multicollinearity well and prevents overfitting.

Limitations: Does not perform feature selection (all features remain in the model).

3. Lasso Regression
Description: Similar to Ridge but uses L1 regularization (sum of absolute coefficients), which can drive some coefficients to zero.

Strengths: Performs feature selection by eliminating less important features.

Limitations: May struggle with highly correlated features.

4. Random Forest Regressor
Description: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.

Strengths: Handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers, and provides feature importance.

Limitations: Can be computationally expensive and less interpretable.

5. Support Vector Machine (SVR)
Description: Uses support vector machines for regression tasks by finding a hyperplane that best fits the data.

Strengths: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and with non-linear data (using kernels).

Limitations: Memory intensive and requires careful parameter tuning.

6. XGBoost Regressor
Description: An optimized gradient boosting implementation that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting errors of the previous ones.

Strengths: High performance, handles missing values well, and prevents overfitting.

Limitations: Can be complex to tune and computationally demanding.

üèÜ Performance Comparison
Based on the evaluation metrics (MSE and R¬≤ score), the models performed as follows from best to worst:

XGBoost Regressor - Highest R¬≤ score and lowest MSE, indicating the best performance

Random Forest Regressor - Strong performance, close to XGBoost

Ridge Regression - Best among linear models

Linear Regression - Moderate performance

Lasso Regression - Slightly worse than other linear models

Support Vector Machine (SVR) - Lowest performance in this implementation

Note: The exact performance metrics may vary slightly depending on the random seed and specific dataset characteristics.

üíª Usage
Download the dataset:

python
import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("prokshitha/home-value-insights")
Load and preprocess data:

python
df = pd.read_csv(path + "/house_price_regression_dataset.csv")
Run the model training and evaluation:
The code will automatically:

Handle missing values by removing rows with null values

Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

Train all six models

Evaluate and compare performance using MSE and R¬≤ metrics

View results:
The script outputs performance metrics for each model and displays a bar chart comparing R¬≤ scores across all models.

üìà Evaluation Metrics
The project evaluates models based on two key metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.

R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination): Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable that's predictable from the features. Higher values indicate better performance (closer to 1.0 is better).

üîß Customization
To modify the project:

Adjust model parameters: Modify the hyperparameters in the models dictionary

Change test/train split: Modify the test_size parameter in train_test_split (currently 80/20)

Add feature engineering: Implement additional preprocessing steps before model training

Implement additional models: Add new regression models to the comparison

Example of modifying XGBoost parameters:

python
'XGBoost': XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=200, 
    max_depth=6, 
    learning_rate=0.1, 
    random_state=42,
    objective="reg:squarederror"
)
